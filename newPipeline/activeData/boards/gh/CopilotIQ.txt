			<h1><strong>CopilotIQ Medical Group Telehealth Informed Consent</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telehealth involves the use of secure electronic communications, information technology, or other means to enable a healthcare provider and a patient at different locations to communicate and share individual patient health information for the purpose of rendering clinical care.  This “</span><b>Telehealth Informed Consent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” informs the patient (“</span><b>patient,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” “</span><b>you,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or “</span><b>your</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) concerning the treatment methods, risks, and limitations of using a telehealth platform.  </span></p>
<p><b>Services Provided:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telehealth services offered by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CopilotIQ Medical, P.A., CopilotIQ P.C., Provide Locums Healthcare Providers LLC </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(“</span><b>CopilotIQ Medical</b> <b>Group</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the CopilotIQ Medical Group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s engaged providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (our “</span><b>Providers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or your “</span><b>Provider</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) may include a patient consultation, diagnosis, treatment recommendation, prescription, and/or a referral to in-person care, as determined clinically appropriate (the “</span><b>Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CopilotIQ, Inc. does not provide the Services; it performs administrative, payment, and other supportive activities for CopilotIQ Medical Group and our Providers.</span></p>
<p><b>Electronic Transmissions:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The types of electronic transmissions that may occur using the telehealth platform include, but are not limited to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appointment scheduling; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completion, exchange, and review of medical intake forms and other clinically relevant information (for example: health records; images; output data from medical devices; sound and video files; diagnostic and/or lab test results) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">between you and your Provider</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via: </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asynchronous communications; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-way interactive audio in combination with store-and-forward communications; and/or </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-way interactive audio and video interaction;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treatment recommendations by your Provider based upon such review and exchange of clinical information;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery of a consultation report with a diagnosis, treatment and/or prescription recommendations, as deemed clinically relevant; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prescription refill reminders (if applicable); and/or </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other electronic transmissions for the purpose of rendering clinical care to you.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Expected Benefits:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved access to care by enabling you to remain in your preferred location while your Provider consults with you.  Our telehealth services are available 8AM-5PM CST hours a day, 5 days a week.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenient access to follow-up care.  If you need to receive non-emergent follow-up care related to your treatment, please contact your Provider by asking your dedicated nurse to schedule an appointment on your behalf, or by contacting your Provider directly through the patient app.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More efficient care evaluation and management. Your results are analyzed by our system and any anomalies are automatically escalated to your nurse or a Provider as appropriate. We strive to respond to patients that reach out within the same business day, and have after hours support on the weekends and holidays for critical issues.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Service Limitations: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary difference between telehealth and direct in-person service delivery is the inability to have direct, physical contact with the patient. Accordingly, some clinical needs may not be appropriate for a telehealth visit and your Provider will make that determination.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>OUR PROVIDERS DO NOT ADDRESS MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. IF YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU SHOULD DIAL 9-1-1 AND/OR GO TO THE NEAREST EMERGENCY ROOM.  PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTACT COPILOTIQ, INC., GROUP, OR YOUR PROVIDER.  AFTER RECEIVING EMERGENCY HEALTHCARE TREATMENT, YOU SHOULD VISIT YOUR LOCAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER.</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Providers are an addition to, and not a replacement for, your local primary care provider.  Responsibility for your overall medical care should remain with your local primary care provider, if you have one, and we strongly encourage you to locate one if you do not.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CopilotIQ Medical Group does not have any in-person clinic locations. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Security Measures:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electronic communication systems we use will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.  All the Services delivered to the patient through telehealth will be delivered over a secure connection that complies with the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). </span></p>
<p><b>Possible Risks: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delays in evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment and technologies, or provider availability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event of an inability to communicate as a result of a technological or equipment failure, please contact the CopilotIQ Medical Group at 615-412-8777 or support@copilotiq.com. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In rare events, your Provider may determine that the transmitted information is of inadequate quality, thus necessitating a rescheduled telehealth consult or an in-person meeting with your local primary care doctor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In very rare events, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Patient Acknowledgments:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I further acknowledge and understand the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the telehealth visit, I have elected to be assigned to the next available provider from CopilotIQ Medical Group, and have been given my Provider’s credentials.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I am experiencing a medical emergency, I will be directed to dial 9-1-1 immediately and my Provider is not able to connect me directly to any local emergency services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I may elect to seek services from a medical group with in-person clinics as an alternative to receiving telehealth services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telehealth in the course of my care at any time without affecting my right to future care or treatment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal and state law requires health care providers to protect the privacy and the security of health information.  I am entitled to all confidentiality protections under applicable federal and state laws.  I understand all medical reports resulting from the telehealth visit are part of my medical record.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CopilotIQ Medical Group </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will take steps to make sure that my health information is not seen by anyone who should not see it. Telehealth may involve electronic communication of my personal health information to other health practitioners who may be located in other areas, including out of state. I consent to CopilotIQ Medical Group using and disclosing my health information for purposes of my treatment (e.g., prescription information) and care coordination, to receive reimbursement for the services provided to me, and for CopilotIQ Medical Group’s health care operations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dissemination of any patient-identifiable images or information from the telehealth visit to researchers or other educational entities will not occur without my consent unless authorized by state or federal law.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a risk of technical failures during the telehealth visit beyond the control of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CopilotIQ Medical Group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In choosing to participate in a telehealth visit, I understand that some parts of the Services involving tests (e.g., labs or bloodwork) may be conducted at another location such as a testing facility, at the direction of my Provider.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persons may be present during the telehealth visit other than my Provider who will be participating in, observing, or listening to my consultation with my Provider (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">e.g.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in order to operate the telehealth technologies). If another person is present during the telehealth visit, I will be informed of the individual’s presence and his/her role.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Provider will explain my diagnosis and its evidentiary basis, and the risks and benefits of various treatment options.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that by creating a treatment plan for me, my Provider has reviewed my medical history and clinical information and, in my Provider’s professional assessment, has made the determination that the provider is able to meet the same standard of care as if the health care services were provided in-person when using the selected telehealth technologies, including but not limited to, asynchronous store-and-forward technology.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have the right to request a copy of my medical records.  I can request to obtain or send a copy of my medical records to my primary care or other designated health care provider by contacting CopilotIQ Medical Group at: www.AthenaHealth.com  A copy will be provided to me at reasonable cost of preparation, shipping and delivery.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is necessary to provide my Provider a complete, accurate, and current medical history.  I understand that I can log into my “Portal” at htts://www.athenahealth.com/patient-login at any time to access, amend, or review my health information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no guarantee that I will be issued a prescription and that the decision of whether a prescription is appropriate will be made in the professional judgement of my Provider.  If my Provider issues a prescription, I have the right to select the pharmacy of my choice.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no guarantee that I will be treated by a CopilotIQ Medical Group provider. My Provider reserves the right to deny care for potential misuse of the Services or for any other reason if, in the professional judgment of my Provider, the provision of the Services is not medically or ethically appropriate.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CopilotIQ records all consultations on the CopilotIQ software platform. We use these recordings for purposes of quality, training, and platform improvement purposes.

<p><strong>Carefully read these terms and conditions of use (“Terms of Use”) as they govern your access to and use of CopilotIQ, Inc.’s (“CopilotIQ,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) Platform. Your acceptance of, and compliance with, these Terms of Use is a condition to your use of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://copilotiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copilotiq.com</a> (our “<strong>Website</strong>”);</li>
<li>CopilotIQ (our “<strong>App</strong>”);</li>
<li>The CopilotIQ compatible devices (our “<strong>Devices</strong>”);</li>
<li>Any products (“<strong>Products</strong>”) available for purchase through our Website and App; and</li>
<li>The services (“<strong>Services</strong>”) made available through our Website, App, and Devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-medical business support services, our Website, App, and Devices are collectively referred to as our “<strong>Platform</strong>.”</p>
<p>CopilotIQ contracts with CopilotIQ Medical, P.A., and CopilotIQ P.C. (“<strong>Medical Group</strong>”), which are independent medical groups with a network of United States based health care providers (each, a “<strong>Provider</strong>”) to provide online telehealth clinical consultations, services, and/or treatment. The professional medical services provided by Medical Group through the use of our Platform are collectively referred to in this Terms of Use as the “<strong>Services</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>By clicking “Accept,” you acknowledge that you have read in its entirety, understand, and fully accept all terms and conditions contained in these Terms of Use, our <a href="https://copilotiq.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>, and the <a href="https://copilotiq.com/notice-of-privacy-practices/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Notice of Privacy Practices</a> provided to you by Medical Group.

ACCORDINGLY, YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT (INCLUDING IN A CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING) to assert or defend your rights under these Terms of Use.

Please review <a href="https://copilotiq.com/terms-of-use/" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-anchor-comp-id="comp-l6z4wtjj" data-anchor="dataItem-l6z4wtop">Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement</a> for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with CopilotIQ.</p>
<h4>1. Services Provided – No Medical Care or Advice</h4>
<p>CopilotIQ is not a medical group and does not provide medical advice, care, and/or treatment. CopilotIQ provides administrative and management services to independent, physician-owned and operated, medical practices. Any telemedicine consults obtained through our Platform are provided by Providers, including but not limited to Medical Group. CopilotIQ licenses the “<strong>CopilotIQ</strong>” brand name to Medical Group and other affiliated medical practices that use our Platform to assist in the provision of Services. Each CopilotIQ-branded practice is owned and operated by a licensed physician. There is no single provider of medical care called “CopilotIQ.” Each CopilotIQ-branded practice engages a network of United States based clinicians who provide clinical telehealth services. The Providers deliver clinical services via the Platform to their patients. CopilotIQ does not provide medical advice or care, own or operate the medical practices, employ or in any way supervise the clinicians providing medical care, and control over the care provided is the sole responsibility of the independent medical practices and the Providers they employ. Services and practices may vary across Providers, and patients should contact the Providers at Medical Group directly for all questions concerning their medical care.</p>
<h4>2. Not For Emergencies</h4>
<p>Our Platform and the Services are not for medical emergencies or urgent situations. You should not disregard or delay seeking medical advice based on anything that appears or does not appear on our Platform. <strong>If you believe you are experiencing an emergency, call 9-1-1 immediately.</strong></p>
<p>You should seek emergency help or follow up care when recommended by a Provider or when otherwise needed. You should continue to consult with your primary provider and other healthcare professionals as recommended. Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider concerning questions you have regarding a medical condition and before stopping, starting, or modifying any treatment.</p>
<h4>3. Risk of Telehealth Services</h4>
<p>By using the Services, you acknowledge the potential risks associated with telehealth services. These include but are not limited to the following: information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical or health care decision making by the Provider; delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of electronic equipment; a lack of access to your medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors; although the electronic systems we use incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, those protocols could fail causing a breach of privacy of your health information.</p>
<h4>4. Privacy Practices</h4>
<p>You agree that information provided by you in connection with the Platform and the Services shall be governed by the <a href="https://copilotiq.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>, which is hereby incorporated and made part of these Terms of Use. You also agree that information provided by you in connection with the Services shall also be governed by the applicable <a href="https://copilotiq.com/notice-of-privacy-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices</a>, and is hereby incorporated and made part of these Terms of Use.</p>
<h4>5. Prescription Policy</h4>
<p>Certain products available through the Platform require a valid prescription by a licensed healthcare provider. You will not be able to obtain a prescription product unless you have completed a consultation with one of the Providers through the Platform, the Provider has determined the prescription product is appropriate for you, and the Provider has written a prescription.</p>
<p>If a Provider determines a prescription product is appropriate for you and writes a prescription, you may fill the prescription at any pharmacy of your choice as prompted during your use of the Services.</p>
<p>You agree that any prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider will be solely for your personal use. You agree to fully and carefully read all provided product information and labels and to contact a physician or pharmacist if you have any questions regarding the prescription. We fully honor patient freedom of choice and, if you receive a prescription for a medication, you always have the option to instruct your Provider to transmit that prescription to the pharmacy of your choice.</p>
<h4>6. Not an Insurance Product</h4>
<p>We are not an insurer, nor do we offer an insurance plan or product. The amounts you pay to us for any Services obtained through the Platform are not insurance premiums. If you desire any type of health or other insurance, you will need to purchase such insurance separately.</p>

<h4>15. Orders and Purchases</h4>
<h5 class="font_5">Online Payments</h5>
<p>You can purchase products or pay for Services on the Platform. To simplify the user experience on the Platform, you are able to pay for your purchases via the Platform with CopilotIQ serving as payment processing agent on your behalf. If you elect to purchase a Service from Medical Group, then the total price you pay includes the amount charged by Medical Group for the Service. We collect the amounts charged by Medical Group on your behalf and pass through to them the payment for their actual charges. Before making a purchase, you will see an itemized invoice listing the actual charges by Medical Group for the Services.</p>
<h5 class="font_5">Subscription Terms</h5>
<p>If you purchase a subscription to our Platform and/or Services, your subscription is continuous and will be automatically renewed at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by <a href="https://copilotiq.com/contact-us/" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-anchor-comp-id="comp-l6z5cwkb" data-anchor="dataItem-l6z5cwny">Contacting Us</a>. If you cancel your subscription, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. CopilotIQ may change the price for your Platform subscription, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Platform after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing prior to the price change going into effect.</p>
<p>We accept credit and debit cards issued by U.S. banks. If a credit card account is being used for a transaction, we may obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the payment. If you enroll to make recurring payments automatically, all charges and fees will be billed to the credit card you designate during the setup process. If you want to designate a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card, you must change your information online. This may temporarily delay your ability to make online payments while we verify your new payment information.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that if you are making online payments that (a) any credit card, debit card and bank account information you supply is true, correct, and complete, (b) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit/debit card company or bank, (c) you will pay the charges incurred by you in the amounts posted, including, without limitation, any applicable taxes, and (d) you are the person in whose name the card was issued and you are authorized to make a purchase or other transaction with the relevant credit card and credit card information. If we are unable to secure funds from the payment method you provide for any reason, including insufficient funds in the payment method or insufficient or inaccurate information provided by you when submitting electronic payment, we may undertake further collection action, including application of fees to the extent permitted by law. You acknowledge and agree that you will not dispute the charges from CopilotIQ, Medical Group, or any third party payment processor with the payment method company, provided the transactions correspond to the terms indicated in these Terms of Use.</p>
<h4>16. Order Acceptance</h4>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason, at our sole discretion. For your convenience, you will not be charged until your payment method is authorized, the order information is verified for accuracy and your order is shipped. Some situations that may result in your order being canceled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge.</p>
<h4>17. Return Policy</h4>
<p>You may return Products purchased on the Platform in accordance with our Return Policy.</p>
<h4>18. Links to Other Sites</h4>

It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select for your use or download is free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other items of a destructive nature. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to the Platform, you do this entirely at your own risk.</p>

You agree that (a) all agreements and consents can be signed electronically and (b) all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such notices and other communications be in writing. CopilotIQ, Medical Group, and your Provider may contact you by telephone, mail, or e-mail to verify your information. CopilotIQ, Medical Group, and your Provider may request further information from you and you agree to provide such further information to ensure that you have not fraudulently used the Platform. If you do not provide this information in the manner requested within 14 days of the request, we reserve the right to suspend, discontinue, or deny your access to and use of our Platform until you provide the information to us as requested.</p>
<h4>22. External Services</h4>
<p>The Platform may enable access to CopilotIQ’s and/or third-party services and websites, including social media sites (collectively and individually, “<strong>External Services</strong>“). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by the Platform or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical, and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by CopilotIQ or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of these Terms of Use or that infringes the intellectual property rights of CopilotIQ or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, or defame any person or entity, and that we are not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. We reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.</p>
<h4>23. Supplemental Terms Applicable to Providers</h4>
<p>These supplemental terms apply to Providers in addition to the other provisions of these Terms of Use. In the event of a conflict between the supplemental terms and any other terms herein, the supplemental terms shall prevail.</p>
<p>To be a healthcare provider using the Platform (for purposes of this Section, “<strong>Provider</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”), you must be a licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or healthcare professional contracted or employed by the Medical Group, and must agree to comply with all laws, medical board rules, and other rules and regulations applicable to you as a Provider or otherwise. Your relationship with the CopilotIQ users (including, but not limited to, your Medical Group patients) is directly between you and the patient. The patient will never have a physician-patient relationship with CopilotIQ. CopilotIQ does not practice medicine and offers no medical services. As set forth more fully below, Provider is solely responsible for all agreements, consents, notices, and other interactions with patients and other consumers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Provider and CopilotIQ are each responsible for all billings and collections from patients and other consumers, and CopilotIQ shall have no liability whatsoever to Provider with respect to any amounts owed by any patient or other consumer to Provider.</p>
<p>We do not provide any medical advice, legal advice, or representations in any way regarding any legal or medical issues associated with Provider, goods, or services offered by Provider, including but not limited to any compliance obligations or steps necessary to comply with any state or federal laws and regulations. Provider should seek legal counsel regarding any legal and compliance issues and should not rely on any materials or content associated with the Platform in determining Provider’s compliance obligations under the law. Provider and CopilotIQ agree that CopilotIQ is not providing to customers, patients, or anyone else, medical advice, or legal advice. <strong>THE PLATFORM IS NOT MEANT TO SUBSTITUTE OR MODIFY YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN ANY WAY.</strong></p>
<p>Provider will use the Platform only in accordance with applicable standards of good medical practice. While software products such as the Platform can facilitate and improve the quality of service that Provider can offer patients, many factors, including but not limited to the provider/patient relationship, can affect a patient’s outcome, and with intricate and interdependent technologies and complex decision-making, it is often difficult or impossible to accurately determine what the factors were and in what proportion they affected an outcome. Provider will advise patients, when reasonably necessary, that Services provided through the Platform may not be a complete or adequate substitute for in-person assessments by the Provider. Provider shall be solely responsible for its use of the Platform and the provision of medical services to Provider’s patients. In this regard, Provider releases CopilotIQ and waives any and all potential claims against CopilotIQ as a result of Provider’s use of the Platform and the provision of Services to Provider’s patients.</p>
<p>As a result of the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the patient care process, Provider agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold CopilotIQ harmless from any claim by or on behalf of any patient of Provider, or by or on behalf of any other third party or person claiming damage by virtue of a familial or financial relationship with such a patient, which is brought against CopilotIQ, regardless of the cause if such claim arises for any reason whatsoever, out of Provider’s use or operation of the Platform. To the extent applicable, Provider will obtain CopilotIQ’s prior written consent to any settlement or judgment in which Provider agrees to any finding of fault of CopilotIQ or defect in the Platform. CopilotIQ will promptly notify Provider in writing of any claim subject to this indemnification, promptly provide Provider with the information reasonably required for the defense of the same, and grant to Provider exclusive control over its defense and settlement.</p>
<p>If you submit, upload, transmit, or post any consents, notices, advice, recommendations, comments, files, videos, images, or other materials to us or our Platform (“<strong>Provider Content</strong>”) or provide any Provider Content to patients or other consumers, you agree not to provide any Provider Content that (a) is defamatory, abusive, libelous, unlawful, obscene, threatening, harassing, fraudulent, pornographic, or harmful, or that could encourage criminal or unethical behavior, (b) violates or infringes the privacy, copyright, trademark, trade dress, trade secrets, or intellectual property rights of any person or entity, or (c) contains or transmits a virus or any other harmful component. Provider is solely responsible for obtaining all necessary agreements and consents from, and providing all required notices to, patients and other consumers. You agree not to contact other users through unsolicited e-mails, telephone calls, mailings, or any other method of communication. You represent and warrant to CopilotIQ that you have the legal right and authorization to upload all Provider Content to the Platform. CopilotIQ shall have a royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable right, and license to use the Provider Content however CopilotIQ desires, including without limitation, to copy, modify, delete in its entirety, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from or sell or distribute such Provider Content or incorporate such Provider Content into any form, medium, or technology throughout the world. CopilotIQ is and shall be under no obligation: (i) to maintain any Provider Content in confidence; (ii) to pay to you any compensation for any Provider Content; or (iii) to respond to any Provider Content.</p>
<p>CopilotIQ does not regularly review Provider Content, but does reserve the right (but not the obligation) to monitor and edit or remove any Provider Content submitted to the Platform. You grant CopilotIQ the right to use the name that you submit in connection with any Provider Content. You agree not to use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any Provider Content. You are and shall remain solely responsible for the content of any Provider Content you post to the Platform or provide to patients or other consumers. CopilotIQ and its affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Provider Content submitted by you or any third party.</p>
<h4>24. No Third Party Rights</h4>
<p>Unless expressly stated in these Terms of Use, nothing herein is intended to confer any rights, obligations, duties, or remedies, on any person other than you, CopilotIQ, Medical Group, and their affiliates. Nothing in the Terms of Use is intended to relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any third persons to you, CopilotIQ, Medical Group, and its affiliates, nor shall any provision give any third parties any right of subrogation or action over against you, CopilotIQ, Medical Group, and its affiliates. The Platform is only provided for your benefit and may not be relied on by any third party.</p>
<h4>25. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement</h4>
<p>We will try to work in good faith to resolve any issue you have with the Platform, including Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Platform, if you bring that issue to the attention of our customer service department. However, we realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a customer’s satisfaction.</p>
<p>You and CopilotIQ agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms of Use or your use of the Platform, including Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Platform, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than bringing a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in court, however, we agree to cooperate with each other to agree to reasonable discovery in light of the issues involved and amount of the claim. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, but in so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the matter had been brought in court, including without limitation, the law on punitive damages as applied by the United States Supreme Court. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and CopilotIQ are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use and any other contractual relationship between you and CopilotIQ.</p>
<p>If you desire to assert a claim against CopilotIQ, and you therefore elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to CopilotIQ, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (“<strong>Notice</strong>“). The Notice to CopilotIQ should be addressed to: CopilotIQ, Inc., Attn: LEGAL NOTICE, 600 12th Ave S, Suite 1000, Nashville, TN 37203 (“<strong>Notice Address</strong>“). If CopilotIQ desires to assert a claim against you and therefore elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. A Notice, whether sent by you or by CopilotIQ, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>“). If CopilotIQ and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or CopilotIQ may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by CopilotIQ or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Any arbitration brought under this section shall be brought in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You and CopilotIQ agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Products, Platform, Services or this Agreement must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. You understand that, in return for agreement to this provision, CopilotIQ is able to offer the Service at the terms designated, and that your assent to this provision is an indispensable consideration to this Agreement.</p>
<p>YOU AND COPILOTIQ AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and CopilotIQ agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.</p>
<p>If this Agreement to Arbitrate provision is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts located in and for Delaware. Both CopilotIQ and you agree to waive any and all rights to a jury trial in the event this agreement to arbitrate is found to be unenforceable.</p>
<h4>26. Indemnification</h4>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold CopilotIQ and any affiliates harmless from and against any and all rights, demands, losses, liabilities, damages, claims, causes of action, actions, and suits (no matter whether at law or equity), fees, costs, and attorney’s fees of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with: (i) your use or misuse of the Platform, Products, Services, or any information posted on the Platform; (ii) your breach of the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy; (iii) the content or subject matter of any information you provide to CopilotIQ, Medical Group, your Provider, or a customer service agent; or (iv) any negligent or wrongful act or omission by you in your use or misuse of the Platform, Products, Services, or any information on the Platform, including without limitation, infringement of third party intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or negligent or wrongful conduct.</p>

			<h1><strong>Informed Consent for Remote Patient Monitoring Services and Co-Payment</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) involves the use of electronic communications and devices that automatically record data to enable healthcare providers at different locations to monitor physiologic metrics and share individual patient medical information for the purpose of managing patient care. RPM services offered by your medical group, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CopilotIQ Medical, P.A.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the “Medical Group”) may monitor a variety of physiologic metrics, including, without limitation</span><b> blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, glucose levels (pre and post meal), exercise, weight, steps walked, and sleep quantity and quality</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Medical Group has partnered with CopilotIQ, Inc. (“CopilotIQ”) to provide you with the RPM services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electronic monitoring systems we use will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These RPM services</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are an addition to, and not a replacement for, your primary care physician.  Responsibility for your overall medical care should remain with your local primary care doctor, if you have one, and we strongly encourage you to locate one if you do not.</span></p>
<p><b>Expected Benefits:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved access to care by enabling you to remain in your home while a clinical care team obtains results at distant/other sites.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More efficient care evaluation and management.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Possible Risks: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delays in evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment and technologies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In rare events, your provider may determine that the transmitted information is of inadequate quality, thus necessitating an in-person meeting with your local primary care doctor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In very rare events, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to receive follow-up care, assistance in the event of an inability to communicate as a result of a technological or equipment failure, please contact your local physician.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By checking the box associated with &#8220;</span><b>INFORMED CONSENT</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;, you acknowledge that you understand and agree with the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hereby consent to receiving RPM services.  I understand that the RPM services are provided in connection with my current treatment plan with the Medical Group.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that federal and state law requires health care providers to protect the privacy and the security of health information.  I understand that the Medical Group will take steps to make sure that my health information is not seen by anyone who should not see it, in accordance with Medical Group’s standard practices. I understand that RPM services may involve electronic communication or monitoring of my personal medical information to or by other health practitioners or clinical staff who may be located in other areas, including out of state.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand there is a risk of technical failures during the RPM services beyond the control of the Medical Group and CopilotIQ.  I agree to hold harmless Medical Group and CopilotIQ for delays in evaluation or for information lost due to such technical failures.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to RPM in the course of my care at any time, without affecting my right to future care or treatment. I understand that I may suspend or terminate use of the RPM services at any time for any reason or for no reason.  I understand that if I am experiencing a medical emergency, that I will be directed to dial 9-1-1 immediately and that Medical Group or Medical Group’s clinical staff are not able to connect me directly to any local emergency services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of RPM in my care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that my healthcare information may be shared with other individuals for scheduling and billing purposes. Persons may be present during the consultation other than the Medical Group in order to operate the RPM technologies. I further understand that I will be informed of their presence in the consultation and thus will have the right to request the following: (1) omit specific details of my medical history/examination that are personally sensitive to me; (2) ask non-medical personnel to leave the consultation; and/or (3) terminate the consultation at any time.</span></li>
